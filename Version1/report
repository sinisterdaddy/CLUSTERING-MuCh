This progress report highlights the advancements made in the clustering algorithm utilized for organizing detector data within the mCBM setup. By addressing limitations of the previous approach and introducing dynamic adaptations to temporal patterns, the updated algorithm achieves more precise and efficient clustering. Furthermore, enhancements in spatial separation and hit formation contribute to improved accuracy and fidelity in identifying and analyzing hits within the detector system.

The previous clustering algorithm provided a foundational framework for organizing detector data into clusters based on a fixed time interval (fClusterSeparationTime). This approach, while effective for basic event-by-event processing, had limitations when it came to handling more complex temporal patterns within the data. Recognizing these limitations, the updated clustering algorithm introduces a series of novel conditions to dynamically adapt to the temporal characteristics of the data.

Condition 1 remains rooted in the original concept of creating new time slices when the time gap between consecutive digis exceeds the predefined threshold (fClusterSeparationTime). This ensures that events occurring after a certain time interval are grouped separately, maintaining temporal coherence within each cluster.

Condition 2 represents a significant improvement by introducing a check for digis hitting already fired pads. This addition ensures that if a digi hits a pad that has already been fired within the current time slice, it is assigned to a different time slice. This refinement minimizes the risk of erroneously grouping digis that belong to distinct temporal events.

Condition 3 represents a more intricate level of refinement by considering the specific time differences between consecutive digis. It evaluates the time difference between the current digi and its neighboring digis, allowing the algorithm to adapt dynamically to the temporal distribution of events. By comparing the time differences and adjusting the time slices accordingly, the algorithm can better capture the nuanced temporal patterns present in the data.

Overall, these enhancements represent a significant step forward in the clustering algorithm's capabilities. By incorporating dynamic adjustments based on real-time data characteristics, the algorithm can achieve more precise and efficient clustering, ultimately leading to improved hit detection and analysis within the detector system.


In addition to the advancements in time-based clustering, the updated algorithm maintains and enhances spatial separation capabilities present in the previous version. After the initial time-based clustering process, the algorithm proceeds to perform spatial separation to further refine the cluster organization. This spatial separation step ensures that clustered digis are not only temporally coherent but also spatially contiguous, reflecting the physical layout and properties of the detector system. By combining both temporal and spatial considerations, the algorithm achieves a comprehensive approach to cluster formation, capturing both the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of events within the detector. This integrated approach enhances the accuracy and fidelity of the clustering process, leading to more precise identification and analysis of hits within the detector system.


Furthermore, the updated algorithm introduces a significant improvement in hit formation within clusters. Unlike the previous version, which selected only local maxima as hits without considering the contributions from neighboring digis, the new approach incorporates the influence of all neighboring digis within the cluster during hit formation. This enhancement allows the algorithm to generate hits that more accurately represent the collective signal strength and spatial distribution of the cluster. By accounting for the combined effects of neighboring digis, the algorithm produces hits that not only capture individual local maxima but also reflect the broader context of neighboring digis, leading to a more comprehensive representation of the underlying physical processes. Additionally, the algorithm addresses issues related to the storage and management of cluster count data, ensuring improved data integrity and accurate tracking and utilization of cluster information throughout the algorithmic process.


The updated clustering algorithm improves upon the previous version by dynamically adapting to temporal patterns and maintaining spatial separation capabilities. It enhances hit formation by considering contributions from neighboring digis within clusters, leading to more accurate representation of signal strength and spatial distribution. Additionally, the algorithm improves data integrity and management for enhanced tracking and utilization of cluster information.
